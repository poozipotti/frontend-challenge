# Spartacus Frontend Challenge

The whole project ended taking me ~5 hours. A lot of this time was spent on styling and adding the highlighting feature, the core problems probably only took about half the time. 

I didn't mind taking the extra time, It's been a long time since I've messed around with vanilla javascript and it was super fun to see how much I really remembered about dom manipulation without all the bells and whistles. 
I can't think of anything in particular I'd wish was different about the challenge, It really was a lot fun to do.
