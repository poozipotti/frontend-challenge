          <h3>On Style</h3>
          <p>
            Most of the styling was copied or inspied from the Spartacus website. I wanted to give
            the site a little bit of a facelift, but still economical with my time. I thought a
            great place to look would be none other than the Spartacus Website Itself!
          </p>
          <h3>Search Text</h3>
          <p>
            Initially, I didn't realize that the textContent on a DomNode includes all descendants
            and did some research into the
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TreeWalker">Treewalker API</a>
            to traverse the dom and find text occurences. It ended up with way more occurences than
            were really there, because I was searching the same text multiple times. Even though it
            didn't pan out in the end, I'm still happy to have checked out an old browser api!
          </p>
          <p>
            With Treewalker out of the way, I had some extra time to work on highlighting the
            searched word. In retrospect this turned out to be the hardest part of the project.
            (That's what I get for extra credit!) The difficulty here was because I needed to parse
            the raw html to add span tags and higlight the word or phrase. It turned out to be a ton
            of work to make sure I wasn't breaking the html when a word was searched that
            corresponped to an html tag. I tried a few different solutions to manually parse through
            the html, but I ended up using a regex in the end. It isn't perfect, but I decided to
            leave it in as is rather than nix the feature entirely. The highlighter also can't
            highlight across html tags. I think corrext way to do this in production would be to
            parse through the html yourself word by word, or to utilize a library.
          </p>
          <h3>Image Rotator</h3>
          <p>
            The image Rotator Was very straightfoward. I started by poking around to get some
            inspiration, then I got to coding. I ended up going with a pretty long fade in, because
            I thought it suited the moodiness of the photos themselves best. One thing I did have an
            issue with was responsiveness and image height. I ended up playing with widths until I
            got something I was happy with at most sizes. Because I used CSS grid, the bottom text
            will get pushed out at sizes smaller than 400px. I chose to keep it that way because The
            image gets way to busy with all the text. It's not a bug, it's a feature!

          Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not
          found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin
          live so far south. Several species are found in the
          <a href="/wiki/Temperate" class="mw-redirect" title="Temperate">temperate</a> zone, but
          one species, the

          Among extant penguins, larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are
          generally found in temperate or even tropical climates. Some
          <a href="/wiki/Prehistoric" class="mw-redirect" title="Prehistoric">prehistoric</a>
          species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human. These
          were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,
          <a href="/wiki/Subantarctic" title="Subantarctic">subantarctic</a> regions harboured high
          diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region around 2,000&nbsp;km south
