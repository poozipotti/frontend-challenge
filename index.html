          <h3>On Style</h3>
          <p>
            Most of the styling was copied or inspied from the Spartacus website. I wanted to give
            the site a little bit of a facelift, but still economical with my time. I thought a
            great place to look would be none other than the Spartacus Website Itself!
          </p>
          <h3>Search Text</h3>
          <p>
            Initially, I didn't realize that the textContent on a DomNode includes all descendants
            and did some research into the
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TreeWalker">Treewalker API</a>
            to traverse the dom and find text occurences. It ended up with way more occurences than
            were really there, because I was searching the same text multiple times. Even though it
            didn't pan out in the end, I'm still happy to have checked out an old browser api!
          </p>
          <p>
            With Treewalker out of the way, I had some extra time to work on highlighting the
            searched word. In retrospect this turned out to be the hardest part of the project.
            (That's what I get for extra credit!) The difficulty here was because I needed to parse
            the raw html to add span tags and higlight the word or phrase. It turned out to be a ton
            of work to make sure I wasn't breaking the html when a word was searched that
            corresponped to an html tag. I tried a few different solutions to manually parse through
            the html, but I ended up using a regex in the end. It isn't perfect, but I decided to
            leave it in as is rather than nix the feature entirely.
          </p>
          <p>
            The highlighter also can't highlight across html tags. I think corrext way to do this in
            production would be to parse through the html yourself word by word, or to utilize a
            library.
          </p>
          <h3>Image Rotator</h3>
          <p>
            The image Rotator Was very straightfoward. I started by poking around to get some
            inspiration, then I got to coding. I ended up going with a pretty long fade in, because
            I thought it suited the moodiness of the photos themselves best. The nice thing about
            using grid to overlap elements is it's much more predictble than using absolute and
            relative positioning, and allows the element to be more responsive.

          Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not
          found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin
          live so far south. Several species are found in the
          <a href="/wiki/Temperate" class="mw-redirect" title="Temperate">temperate</a> zone, but
          one species, the

          Among extant penguins, larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are
          generally found in temperate or even tropical climates. Some
          <a href="/wiki/Prehistoric" class="mw-redirect" title="Prehistoric">prehistoric</a>
          species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human. These
          were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,
          <a href="/wiki/Subantarctic" title="Subantarctic">subantarctic</a> regions harboured high
          diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region around 2,000&nbsp;km south
