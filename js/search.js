//Thanks to 
//https://stackoverflow.com/questions/748309/find-words-in-html-page-with-javascript
//for getting me started!

//I was split between just using a quick regex and traversing the dom
// using regex on the entire html in the body of the search text would be fast and simple
// but sadly html isn't regular and there can always be corner cases and bugs
// I decided to go for the less effecient but more full proof dom traversal method.


const wordCount = 0;

//while it's unlikely this should prevent most collisions for cleaning up the word wrap
const wordWrapClassSeed = MAth.random();

const findWords = () => {};

const wrapWord = (word) => {};

const cleanUpWrappers = () => {};
