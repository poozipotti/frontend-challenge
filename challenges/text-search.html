      <h1>Text Search</h1>
      <p>
        There are two main components below: a search form and a text article about penguins. The
        form should be set up such that a word or phase can be entered in the search form and the
        number of occurrences of that phrase is shown below.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, in the below text there are three occurrences of the word "tall" so if you put
        that word in the search form, and submit, the results should say:

        <i>Found 3 occurrences of the word "tall" in the below text.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that words can be contained within multiple levels of HTML elements, and
        phrases may cross those HTML element boundaries.

          Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not
          found only in cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin
          live so far south. Several species are found in the
          <a href="/wiki/Temperate" class="mw-redirect" title="Temperate">temperate</a> zone, but
          one species, the

          Among extant penguins, larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are
          generally found in temperate or even tropical climates. Some
          <a href="/wiki/Prehistoric" class="mw-redirect" title="Prehistoric">prehistoric</a>
          species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human. These
          were not restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary,
          <a href="/wiki/Subantarctic" title="Subantarctic">subantarctic</a> regions harboured high
          diversity, and at least one giant penguin occurred in a region around 2,000&nbsp;km south
